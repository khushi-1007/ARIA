# 🆘 ARIA: AI Real-time Incident Assistant
 
**An AI-powered personal safety platform that detects, analyzes, and responds to emergency situations in real time.**
 
ARIA helps individuals quickly alert emergency services during dangerous situations, such as being threatened, followed, harassed, or abducted, while automatically generating actionable intelligence for first responders.
 
---
 
## 🚨 The Problem
 
When someone is in danger, every second counts, but most safety apps stop at "send an alert." They don't tell responders *what's happening*, *how serious it is*, or *where to look*. ARIA closes that gap by combining real-time location tracking, audio evidence capture, and AI-driven threat analysis into a single incident pipeline that flows straight to a police dispatch dashboard.

## ✨ What ARIA Does
 
| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| 🔴 **SOS Trigger** | Manual or automatic emergency activation from the mobile app |
| 📍 **Live GPS Tracking** | Real-time location streaming during an active incident |
| 🎙️ **Audio Evidence Capture** | Records and securely transmits audio for analysis |
| 🧠 **AI Threat Analysis** | Transcribes speech (Whisper) and analyzes tone & context |
| 📊 **Risk Scoring** | Generates a real-time risk score for prioritizing response |
| 🚓 **Police Dispatch Dashboard** | Live view of incidents, locations, and risk levels for responders |
| 📄 **Incident Dossier (PDF)** | Auto-generated, police-ready report with evidence and transcript |
| 🛣️ **Safe Ride Mode** | Passive monitoring during commutes or rideshares |

 ## 🧩 How It Works
 
```
 User in Danger
       │
       ▼
 1. SOS Triggered (manual / automatic)
       │
       ▼
 2. GPS Coordinates Captured
       │
       ▼
 3. Audio Evidence Recorded → sent to AI Engine
       │
       ▼
 4. AI Engine generates:
       • Transcript
       • Risk Score
       • Threat Context
       │
       ▼
 5. Backend creates & stores Incident
       │
       ▼
 6. Incident emitted via Socket.IO (real-time)
       │
       ▼
 7. Police Dashboard receives live update
       │
       ▼
 8. PDF Incident Dossier generated for responders
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture
 
ARIA is built as four cooperating services:
 
```

### 1. Frontend: User App
- **Stack:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Socket.IO Client, Axios
- **Screens:** Home Dashboard, Monitor, Safe Ride, Logs, Contacts, Profile
- **Responsibilities:** authentication, SOS activation, live GPS, incident history, contacts & profile management
- **Deployment:** Vercel
### 2. Backend API Server
- **Stack:** Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, PostgreSQL, JWT, Multer
- **Responsibilities:** authentication, incident management, police-facing APIs, report generation, GPS streaming, real-time socket events
- **Deployment:** Render
### 3. AI Engine
- **Stack:** Python, FastAPI, OpenAI Whisper, custom risk-scoring & context/tone analysis models
- **Responsibilities:** audio transcription, threat detection, contextual risk scoring, incident intelligence generation
- **Deployment:** Render
### 4. Police Dispatch Dashboard
- **Stack:** React, Vite, Socket.IO Client, Axios
- **Responsibilities:** live incident monitoring, risk score visibility, GPS tracking, report generation, incident resolution
- **Auth:** `X-Police-API-Key` header
- **Deployment:** Vercel
### Database
- **Provider:** Neon PostgreSQL
- **Core tables:** `users`, `incidents`, `reports`, plus supporting operational entities
### Real-Time Layer
- **Technology:** Socket.IO
- **Purpose:** live incident creation, GPS updates, and instant dashboard synchronization between the user app, backend, and police dashboard
---
 
## 🔐 Security & Reliability
 
- **JWT-based authentication** on all sensitive routes (profile, incident creation, report generation)
- **API key authentication** for the police dispatch dashboard
- **No hardcoded localhost URLs**, fully environment-aware via `BACKEND_URL` / `VITE_API_URL`
- **No fake GPS data**: real coordinates only, with `0,0` as an explicit "unavailable" fallback (never a fabricated default location)
- **HTTPS-compatible** geolocation handling with graceful error states
---
 
## ⚙️ Environment Variables
 
**Backend**
```
DATABASE_URL
JWT_SECRET
AI_ENGINE_URL
BACKEND_URL
POLICE_API_KEY
```
 
**Frontend (User App)**
```
VITE_API_URL
```
 
**Police Dashboard**
```

## 🤝 Why ARIA Matters
 
Personal safety apps are common; real-time, AI-analyzed, responder-ready intelligence is not. ARIA isn't just an alarm button; it's a pipeline that turns a moment of crisis into structured, actionable information for the people who can actually help, delivered in seconds.
